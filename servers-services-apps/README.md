Work based on the book 'Rust Servers, Services, and Apps' by Prabhu Eshwarla, along with a little bit of my own modifications. Aiming to use this stuff as the foundation for the backend of my own little TypeScript projects. 

Also want to look at websockets and other related topics which are not mentioned in the book, maybe even Jon Gjengset's series on building TCP in Rust.
