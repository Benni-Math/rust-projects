# [Writing a Microservice in Rust](http://www.goldsborough.me/rust/web/tutorial/2018/01/20/17-01-11-writing_a_microservice_in_rust/)

This project is a way for me to familiarize myself with the Rust web ecosystem,
i.e. tools and coding patterns for writing web applications and APIs in Rust.

Run `docker-compose up` to start the service.
